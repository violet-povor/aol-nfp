                                   I began my Mindfulness training with teacher Shinzen Young in 1987 and started teaching it in 1996. Over the years, I’ve taught Mindfulness to thousands on people. In 1999, I trained with Jon Kabat-Zinn and learned about the MBSR (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction) program that he developed. From the beginning, I’ve been less interested in whether participants enjoyed my teaching, and more about whether I was actually making a difference in their lives. I began trying to measure results as objectively as possible, using tools that I got from Jon Kabat-Zinn’s training program. The measured results achieved have ALWAYS been positive, almost always impressive, and sometimes quite spectacular.

                                    <p><strong>Mindfulness</strong> is the meditative practice of non-judgmental attentiveness to our experience in the present moment.</p>

                                    <p>It focuses on developing two fundamental skills: <strong>awareness</strong> and <strong>equanimity</strong>.  Awareness is the ability to concentrate attention on what is going on right now, whereas equanimity is the ability to remain calm and relaxed in the midst of any stressful situations. 
                                        Sounds simple yet very much applicable to daily life situations!</p>

                                    <p>Since we are most of the time occupied by our memories of the past or worries for the
                                    future, we don’t have the power to experience the present moment to our full capacity, concentrating all of our mental, emotional and physical skills to get the best possible <strong>'outcome of the moment'</strong>.</p>

                                    <p>However, the practice of mindfulness can completely change our life, and changes are noticeable almost immediately.</p>

                                    <p>Being rooted in ancient practice, the positive effects of mindfulness meditation
                                    have lately also been <a href="https://www.mindful.org/science-reveals-well-skill/" target="_blank">recognized by the scientific community</a>. Mindfulness has been used to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4873598/" target="_blank">help people cope with daily life stressors</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEMUDaLMWJ8" target="_blank">wide range of health issues including cancer, cardiovascular disease, immune system disorder, depression, anxiety, ADD/ADHD </a>, and also <a href="https://lawyerist.com/increase-focus-productivity-mindfulness/" target="_blank">boosts your concentration and productivity.</a></p> 

                                    <p>While the science endorses its supportive role, we, at the <strong>Art of Life Community Health Centre</strong>, approach mindfulness as a way of living. What we are working towards goes beyond the typical sitting meditation practice. Rather, we are aiming to
                                    cultivate a mindful way of living that helps us to engage more fully with life by changing how we relate to our external circumstances and internal experiences. This ability to balance our lives can happen through consistent practice and support from others who are also on this journey.</p>

                                    <p>We invite you to begin the learning process towards mindfulness and experience a way of effectively coping with the stresses and thriving despite all of life’s challenges.</p>

                                    <p>The Art of Life Community Health Centre has been committed to using integrative approach to improving our patients’ physical, emotional and mental health. Aiming to merge the art and science of positive growth and healthy living, we are offering an 8-week Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction course taught by an experienced
                                    instructor.</p>

                              <p>Mindfulness Meditation is known for its benefits over a wide range of physical and
                                   psychological phenomena, including cardiovascular disease, all types of stress
                                   disorders, depression, anxiety, and ADD/ADHD.

                                   Mindfulness meditation focuses on developing two fundamental skills: awareness
                                   and equanimity. Awareness is the ability to concentrate attention on a certain
                                   object or phenomena, whereas equanimity is the ability to remain calm and relaxed
                                   in the midst of stressful situations.

                                   For a number of years starting twice a year in 2009, The Art of Life CHC offered
                                   Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBRS) classes for community members suffering
                                   of stress related disorders. More recently, the Art of Life CHC has introduced new
                                   variations of MBSR program for teenagers and their parents.

                                   emotional and psychological challenges brought on by the pressures of school,
                                   family and society. Teenagers who are suffering from psychological stress,

                                   <p>Mindfulness meditation was indeed a new thing for me. But it impacted my approach
                                        to certain situations making life a lot simpler and enjoyable.
                                        Without this knowledge I would never have overcome barriers such as stress.
                                        I found Lou a great coordinator and an inspiration; his life story encourages
                                        me to become a more self-aware and humble person.

                                   The demands of life often affect our ability to be parents and to deepen our
                                   relationships with our children. The ability to listen to our kids and maintain a
                                   calm attitude is important for developing trusting child-parent relationships.
                                   This program component is tailored for parents who are looking for a new perspective
                                   on handling work and family pressures with greater patience and understanding.

                                   We have already achieved some impressive results. Based on the 99 questions survey
                                   filled out at the beginning and at the end of the course, over 90% of class
                                   participants reported observable changes in their fundamental skills of concentration
                                   and paying attention, improved physical and emotional health, and better eating and sleeping.
