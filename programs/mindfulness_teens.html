                                   Is there an area of your life that can use a bit more patience, resilience and calm?
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                        Is there a relationship in your life that can benefit from greater understanding, easier communication, and more sincerity?

                                   <p>Mindfulness is the practice of living in the present moment. Practicing mindfulness will save you from the misery of worrying about the past or fearing the future. It will help you to stay calm and collected in challenging circumstances and give you the freedom to make conscious choices about the things that matter most.
                                   </p>

                                                    What is the Teen Mindfulness Interactive Group?
                                                  </h2>
                                                 <p>We are hosting an Interactive Mindfulness Meditation group for teens, to share experiences about the stresses in our lives and help each other gain inner control through mindful awareness! This means always having with you a real, practical tool to manage anxiety, stress levels, tension in your body and those repetitive, annoying thoughts that just play in your head like a broken record. With a little practice in mindfulness, you can get rid of them!.</p>
                                                      <p>

We'll start by introducing Mindfulness to you. What is it? Why it has been practiced from ancient times in different ways and what are the benefits? It's accessible to everyone, easy to get started, can be practiced anywhere and at any time - all you need is a little bit of time and a willingness to try something new. </p>


 
<p>After a light refreshments break, we'll facilitat a group conversation with the teens, to listen to your concerns, what distresses and challenges you, and can mindfulness help?</p>

<p>
Our experienced mindfulness instructor, Lou Carcasole, will be moderating the group and guiding us through a small meditation at the end.
</p>
<p>
This event is completely free and is meant for teens, however, parents, facilitators, educators, guardians are all welcome to learn more about the Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction Program and its benefits to our community.
</p>
<p>
Thanks and hope to see you at the event. Please feel free to share this info with others.
