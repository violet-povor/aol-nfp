                              <p>Nia is a sensory-based movement activity, celebrating the harmony of body, mind and
                                   spirit expressed throughout the joy of movement. Nia incorporates philosophy and body
                                   movements of the most advanced Eastern and Western arts, including dance, martial
                                   and healing arts. It is based on joy, empowerment, self-awareness, mental clarity,
                                   emotion balancing, self-harmonization and self-healing.
                              </p>

                                   The Art of Life shares the purpose of the Nia exercise, which is to grow a worldwide
                                   community of healthy people who are empowered to do great things. We believe all
                                   people can discover, explore and enhance their individual potential to live a
                                   fulfilling and meaningful life – by engaging their senses and listening to their bodies.
                                   With the right tools and education we can increase our confidence and happiness.
                                   We can become connected to others to shape a consciousness that extends beyond our own.
                              </p>
                              <p> Nia is designed for everyone. You do not need any experience in dance, fitness
                                   or martial arts to enjoy Nia and benefit from it. There are three levels of intensity
                                   in Nia dances, so that you can jump in wherever your body chooses. It is ageless and
                                   limitless, transformational and effective for all people everywhere, from athletes,
                                   dancers and fitness instructors, to children, special needs groups and the elderly.
